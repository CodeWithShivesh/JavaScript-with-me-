`Notes: `


Orignally Javascript is the synchronous language. Which means this is Blocking language (`e.g: wait I'll come. now you're block you have to wait only, you can't do anything untill I'll comeback`), Which refers to single ***threaded language***. For run JS we can use **V8 Engine** only and that makes JS to single threaded language. 

But In the `Browser` or In the `Node Setup` or any other setup which support JS, we are not getting only `V8 Engine`, In every enviroment we'll get many of the function, dependencies and other threads which makes the JS `efficient` and `fast`.
